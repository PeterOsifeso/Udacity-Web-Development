Your response goes here!
I have learnt a whole lot, starting from the use of tags to make text appear in the way I want to doing a whole bunch of cool things.
I have also noticed the importance of the paragraph (<p></p>) element

what has been easy
	Actually, I learnt the basics of html from way back so I had bo problems with typing the tags correctly
	
what has been difficult
	Nothing really for now except that I often forget the alt attribute in the img tags
	
How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
	I remind myself from time to time that I really wanna do this and I have to keep pushing on
